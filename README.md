Coding4Fun.WorkspaceBox
=======================

If you use the TFS and you create a separate work item for each workspace, then you face the situation of using several workspaces at the same time. In that case you need to know which workspace you are changing now or follow the whole track of project in order to define the state of a workspace. Which is not really convenient.

This extension displays the current workspace by its location and therefore will significantly help you to speed up.
